What we did in calculator's was different because the same element was overwritten again and again 
by the DOM manipulation , for that we used .innerHTML but 
what you can do is (----).innerHTML=` 
<div>${title}</div>       // this syntax is called tempelate literals , they allow you to embed expresssions inside string literals ,making it easier to create strings that include varaiables and expresssions 
<div>${desciption}</div>
<button> Add the todo</button>
`

// Now if you overwrite it the past content will get deleted so
document.getElementById("container").innerHTML=` <div>
                                                            <div>${title}</div>
                                                            <div>${description}</div>
                                                            <button> Mark as done</button>
                                                             ${document.getElementById("container").innerHTML} </div>`;
but this will create problem as we are appending everything in same element
// better way to do this is document.createElement("div")
