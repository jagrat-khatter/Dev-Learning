The problem with State TODO 1 is that it clears the DOM every 2ish seconds and rewrites the DOM which 
is very inefficient 
Now question is, how does is calculate what all has changed ?
Has a todo been marked as complete ?
Has a todo been removed from the backend ?

By remebering the old todo (know as virtual TODO)
