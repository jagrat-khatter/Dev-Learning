Express server are transient can be up or down , but database is a central place (ideologicaly) which is 
up 100% , 
So why do we need servers or backends
Why don't we let user hit the database directly ?
What extra does the HTTP server provide exactly ?

1. Databases were created using protocols that browser don't understand .(small reason)
2. Databases don't have granual access as a first class citizen. Very hard to do user specific access to them .Give access pf certain data and do not give access to some other data.
3. There are some databases (firebase) that let you get rid of the HTTP-server and try their best to give granual access

Databases usually allow access to 4 primitives
CRUD - Create Data , Read Data , Upadte Data , Delete Data 

ORM - an ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapper

. It's a programming technique that allows you to interact with a database using an object-oriented paradigm, rather than writing raw SQL queries. Â  
(Basically ORM is library to talk to DataBases, For mongoDB most popular is moongoose but eventually we'll prisma for every DB be it relational or non relational )

In mongoose , first you have to define the schema
This sounds counter intuitive since mongodb is schemaless ?
That is true ,but mongoose(library in express) makes you define schema for things like autocompletions /
Validating data before it goes in the DB to make sure you're doing things right
Schemaless Dbs can be very dangerous , using schemas in mongo makes it slightly less
Dangerous
But through the GUI Compass you can add data without following a certain schema

Cluster - A machine where multiple DBs can operate
DataBase - A place where multiple tables can be stored
Table - A place where entry of simimlar relevence are stored
