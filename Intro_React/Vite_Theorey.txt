A Build Tool:
Vite (French for "fast") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and more efficient development experience for modern web projects.   
It's designed to be especially quick for projects that use frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte.   
Dev Server and Bundler:
Vite acts as both a development server and a production bundler.
In development mode, it leverages native ES modules and HTTP to serve your code.
In production, it uses Rollup to bundle your code for optimized deployment.   
Focus on Speed:
Vite's core philosophy is to significantly improve the speed of development, particularly during the development phase.

It achieves this through:
Native ES Modules: Modern browsers support native ES modules (import/export syntax), allowing Vite to serve your code directly without bundling it all at once.   
On-Demand Compilation: Vite only compiles modules when they are requested by the browser, leading to faster startup times and hot module replacement (HMR).   
How Vite Uses an HTTP Server in Development Mode:

Development Server:
When you run vite dev or npm run dev, Vite starts a lightweight HTTP server.
This server serves your source files directly to the browser.
Native ES Modules:
Instead of bundling all your JavaScript code into a single file, Vite serves individual modules (files) as the browser requests them.   
The browser uses import statements to fetch these modules.
Hot Module Replacement (HMR):
When you make changes to your code, Vite's HTTP server detects those changes and sends updates to the browser.
The browser then updates the affected modules without requiring a full page reload.
This makes development much faster and more efficient.
HTTP Requests:
The browser is making many small HTTP requests to the vite dev server, each time it needs a new module.
Because the browser is making these requests, that is why you can see the changes live in your browser.
