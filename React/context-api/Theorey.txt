# 21. Context API

The Context API is a powerful feature in React that enables you to manage state across your 
application more effectively, especially when dealing with deeply nested components.

The Context API provides a way to share values (state, functions, etc.) between components 
without having to pass props down manually at every level. 

### Jargon

- **Context**: This is created using `React.createContext()`. It serves as a container for 
the data you want to share.

- **Provider**: This component wraps part of your application and provides the context value 
to all its descendants. Any component that is a child of this Provider can access the context.

- **Consumer**: This component subscribes to context changes. It allows you to access the 
context value (using `useContext`  hook)
