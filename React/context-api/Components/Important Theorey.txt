// If a component uses useContext(context1), it will re-render when that context value changes â€” 
// no matter where it appears in the component tree.

// A component will re-render due to context change only if it itself uses the context via 
// useContext(context1) (or context1.Consumer in class components).
// Children that use context will re-render independently, even if the parent doesn't.

// When context value changes, Context.Provider re-renders, but it does not automatically 
// re-render all its children.

// Only those components that use the context value (useContext(context1)) will re-render.

// Other components will not re-render unless:

// They receive new props, or

// Their state changes, or

// Their own parent re-renders due to other causes (not context propagation).
