A rerender means that 
1. React did some work to calculate what all should update in this component
2. The component actually got called (you can put a log to confirm this)
3. The inspector shows you t bounding box around the component

It happens when 
1. A state variable that is being used inside a component changes
2. A parent component rerender triggers all children re-rendering
