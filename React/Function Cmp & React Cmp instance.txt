Let's relate the "function component" vs. "React component instance" distinction to the mistake you
 made in the original code:

function App() {
    // ...

    function WrapperComponent({ innerComponent }) {
        // create a div which has border
        return (
            <div style={{ border: '2px solid black' }}>
                <innerComponent></innerComponent> {/* Incorrect rendering */}
            </div>
        );
    }

    function TextComponent() {
        return <div>Hi there</div>;
    }

    return (
        <>
            <WrapperComponent innerComponent={TextComponent} />
        </>
    );
}
Explanation of the Mistake:

1.  Passing TextComponent (Function Component):

When you wrote <WrapperComponent innerComponent={TextComponent} />, you correctly passed the function component definition TextComponent as a prop to WrapperComponent.
At this point, innerComponent inside WrapperComponent held the function TextComponent.

2.  Incorrect Rendering Attempt:

Inside WrapperComponent, you then tried to render innerComponent using <innerComponent></innerComponent>.
This is where the error occurred. You treated innerComponent (which was the function component definition TextComponent) as if it were an HTML tag or a string.
You were essentially telling React to render a raw function as a DOM element, which React doesn't know how to do.

3.  Correct Rendering (React Component Instance):

To render the TextComponent function component instance, you needed to use <innerComponent />.
This tells React to invoke the innerComponent function (which is TextComponent) and render the JSX that it returns.
Analogy:

Imagine TextComponent as a recipe for a cake.
When you passed TextComponent to WrapperComponent, you passed the recipe.
When you used <innerComponent></innerComponent>, you were trying to put the recipe directly into the oven, which wouldn't work.
When you used <innerComponent />, you were telling the oven to use the recipe to bake a cake, which is the correct way to do it.

In short :TextComponent was a React component (function component) whose syntax to render an instance of
 it is <TextComponent></TextComponent> or <TextComponent />.

innerComponent was a prop holding a React component (function component) definition. To render an 
instance of it, you use the syntax <innerComponent />.(Refernc. wrapper-component)
